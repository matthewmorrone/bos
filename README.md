## To-Do List

### Appearance
+ Smoother sticky header animation
+ Tiny amount of phantom spacing between splash and charity counter
+ Charity counter animation could be better
+ Phantom border around parallax image
+ Model images have that extra border at the bottom. Either hide or modify images
+ Mobile layout could use some work, especially the grids and the splash size. Menu currently hidden
+ Charity animation not triggered on mobile until first scroll event

### Under the Hood
+ Upgrade events section styling and loading to match other sections
+ Newsletter signup doesn't seem to do anything?
+ Optimize and clean up code, reorder and separate out into files
+ Decide what to host and what to grab from CDNs

### Next Steps
+ Testing of website in major mobile and desktop browsers
+ Measurement of load times and implement lazy loading as necessary
+ Research and discussion towards an acceptable content management system
+ Implementation of SPA and routing
