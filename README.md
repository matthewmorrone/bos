## To-Do List
+ Make SPA implementation more efficient
+ Remove hover and put titles under when mobile

### SPA Issues
+ Locally website is in a subdirectory, but on the server it's in the root
+ When paths are several directories deep, content isn't served from the right place

### Appearance
+ SoundCloud and Lightbox Plugins
+ Replace TBA image with portrait version
+ Sticky header animation doesn't seem worth the trouble
+ Parallax animation should be slower and more chaotic

### Next Steps
+ Research best practices for not committing wordpress to github
+ Either manually port galleries, or find a shortcut
+ Consider merging events and galleries categories
+ Instagram and SoundCloud feeds
+ Fewer entries on front page until loaded
+ Events should have a preview image when linked to in iMessage
