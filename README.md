# BOS

## To-Do List
+ Remove hover and put titles under
+ Import, implement and style gallery pages
+ Make SPA implementation more efficient
+ Base tag, logo link and router need server contingencies

### Under the Hood
+ Eliminate use of CSVs
+ Research best practices for not committing wordpress to github

### Appearance
+ SoundCloud and Lightbox Plugins
+ Replace TBA image with portrait version
+ Sticky header animation doesn't seem worth the trouble
+ Parallax animation should be slower and more chaotic

### Next Steps
+ Ensure images are associated with proper posts: galleries
+ Consider merging events and galleries categories
+ Instagram and SoundCloud feeds
+ Fewer entries on front page until loaded
+ Events should have a preview image when linked to in iMessage
