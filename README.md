## To-Do List
+ Render and style pages
+ URL rewrite
+ Decide implementation of URL routing and SPA


### Appearance
+ Replace TBA image with portrait version
+ Sticky header animation doesn't seem worth the trouble
+ Parallax animation should be slower and more chaotic

### Under the Hood
+ Eliminate use of CSVs
+ Research best practices for not committing wordpress to github

### Next Steps
+ Ensure images are associated with proper posts: galleries
+ Consider merging events and galleries categories
+ Instagram and SoundCloud feeds
+ Fewer entries on front page until loaded
+ Events have a preview image when linked to in iMessage
