# BOS

## To-Do List
+ Ensure images are associated with proper posts
+ Render and style pages: might need to rethink routing

### Appearance
+ Replace TBA image with portrait version
+ Sticky header animation doesn't seem worth the trouble
+ Parallax animation should be slower and more chaotic

### Under the Hood
+ Research best practices for not committing wordpress to github
+ Do something about version control for customizations done to wordpress as well as its actual content

### Next Steps
+ Consider merging events and galleries categories
+ Instagram and SoundCloud feeds
+ Fewer entries on front page until loaded
+ Events have a preview image when linked to in iMessage
